    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>The pizza with the perfect combination of acid, fat and heat.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza dough</li>
        <li>1.5 Cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1.5 - 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1.5 cup fresh diced pineapple, thoroughly patted dry</li>
        <li>Dried oregano to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instruction</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Make sure your oven is preheated at 475 degrees F.</li>
        <li>After you have brushed the dough with olive oil and pricked it with a fork, add the toppings. Start pizza sauce, then the cheese, ham, pineapple, and oregano. You can adjust the topping quantities, but donâ€™t overfill it, as this can make the pizza soggy. Important: Thoroughly pat dry the pineapples before adding in order to prevent excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Make the melted butter by combining the melted butter with the garlic powder, oregano, and salt. Brush the borders with the melted garlic butter.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until bubbly and the edges are golden brown. Cut into 8 slices and serve.</li>
    </ol>
